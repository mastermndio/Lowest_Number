# Lowest Number

Your stub code sets up a function called `lowestNumber`. Your job is to write code that will accept an array as a parameter and return the lowest number in the array.

## Hints
- DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME! For the tests to work, it needs to retain the current name
- This will only test the functionality of the `lowestNumber` function in the javascript file. You can add whatever code you need elsewhere to ensure you are doing the right thing.
- This will be testing the data COMING OUT of the function, NOT data displayed on the screen.
- ignore the other files in this repo. The only file you need to modify is the `lowest_number.js`"
- While you DO NOT NEED IT, there might be some array methods you can look into using to help you.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone 
```

2. Enter Lowest Number repo
```bash
cd Lowest-Number
```

3. Run an NPM install to enable the automatic tests
``` bash

4. Run npm test to execute tests when you think you have solved the issue and are redy to test.

```bash
npm run test
```

5. Commit your answers and push code.
